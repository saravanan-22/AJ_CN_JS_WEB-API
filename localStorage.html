    <!-- Here are some key points about Local Storage:

Persistent Storage: Unlike session storage, which is temporary and cleared when the browser session ends, Local Storage provides persistent storage. The data stored in Local Storage remains available even after the user closes and reopens the browser or restarts the computer.

Key-Value Storage: Local Storage uses a key-value pair approach, where data is stored and retrieved using unique keys. Each key is associated with a value, which can be a string representation of any data type, including JSON objects or arrays.

Domain Specific: Local Storage is specific to each origin (domain). Data stored by one website is not accessible to other websites, providing a level of data privacy and security.

Size Limitations: Local Storage has a storage capacity limit, typically around 5MB. It's important to be mindful of the amount of data stored, as exceeding the limit can result in data loss or unexpected behavior.

Access via JavaScript: Local Storage can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript. The localStorage object is provided by the browser's JavaScript API, offering methods like setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), and clear() to store, retrieve, remove, and clear data from Local Storage.

No Expiration: Data stored in Local Storage does not have an expiration date by default. It will persist until explicitly removed by the application or cleared by the user. -->

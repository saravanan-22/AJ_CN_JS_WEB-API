// <!-- Session Storage is another web storage mechanism provided by web browsers, similar to Local Storage. It allows web applications to store data temporarily on the user's web browser, specifically for the duration of the browser session.

// Here are some key points about Session Storage:

// Temporary Storage: Session Storage is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the browser session. When the user closes the browser tab or window, the session storage data is cleared and no longer accessible.

// Key-Value Storage: Like Local Storage, Session Storage uses a key-value pair approach to store data. Data is stored and retrieved using unique keys, and the values can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, JSON objects, or arrays.

// Domain Specific: Similar to Local Storage, Session Storage is specific to each origin (domain). Data stored by one website is not accessible to other websites, providing data privacy and isolation.

// Access via JavaScript: Session Storage can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript. The sessionStorage object is provided by the browser's JavaScript API and offers methods such as setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), and clear() to store, retrieve, remove, and clear data from Session Storage.

// No Expiration: By default, data stored in Session Storage does not have an expiration date. It remains available until the end of the browser session or until the user explicitly clears the session storage.

// Usage Scenarios: Session Storage is commonly used for storing temporary session-related data, such as user authentication tokens, shopping cart information, or form data during multi-step processes. It provides a convenient way to maintain data across multiple pages within a browser session.

// It's important to note that Session Storage is limited to the current browser session and does not persist across multiple sessions or when the browser is closed and reopened. If you need data to persist beyond a single session, Local Storage is more suitable.

// Both Session Storage and Local Storage provide web developers with client-side storage options for managing data within the browser environment, each with its own characteristics and use cases. -->

// localStorage.setItem("AuthorName", "Saravanan");: This line of code uses the localStorage object to set a key-value pair in the web browser's local storage. 
// The key is "AuthorName" and the value is "Saravanan". 
// This means that you are storing the author's name "Saravanan" in the local storage under the key "AuthorName".

// console.log(localStorage);: This line prints the entire content of the local storage to the console. 
// It will display all the key-value pairs that have been stored in the local storage, including the "AuthorName" key and its corresponding value.

// console.log(localStorage.getItem("AuthorName"));: This line uses the getItem() method of the localStorage object to retrieve the value associated with the key "AuthorName" and then prints it to the console. 
// In this case, it will print "Saravanan" because that's the value you previously set.

// localStorage.removeItem("AuthorName");: This line is commented out with // at the beginning, so it won't be executed. 
// If uncommented, it would remove the key-value pair with the key "AuthorName" from the local storage. After this line executes, if you were to try retrieving the value associated with "AuthorName", it would return null.

// localStorage.clear("AuthorName");: This line is also commented out. The clear() method is used to remove all key-value pairs from the local storage. It doesn't take any arguments. However, the correct syntax to use clear() is without any arguments, like this: localStorage.clear();. 
// It would clear all data stored in the local storage, not just the one with the key "AuthorName".
